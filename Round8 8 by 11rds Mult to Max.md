# Round8 8 by 11rds Mult to Max
8 = 1 * 8
18 = 2 * 8
28 = 3 * 8
28 = 4 * 8
48 = 5 * 8
58 = 6 * 8
68 = 7 * 8
78 = 8 * 8

8r * 8r is not 88r, it would be 8r * 11r (9d) as 88 Round8 (72d).
10d * 10d is 100 Decimal.
Thus due to this System noting being a Columnar System, not a Placeholding System. The Multiplication Range is Tilted to the Next Place + 1. Which is Consistent with the Universal Offset of the Minus - 1 due to our Absolute Zero Case being the Only 0 Place.

The Issue when Attempting to Find the Range is we have to Take into Account that when we Move from 88 to 1,11 it is the same count + 1. But in the scope of performing long multiplication and cross referencing our 3 columns verified up to 8,88,88 Round8 as 37,448. As Per Line of this File 33 for 15 bits. The Pattern Holds.

8r * 8r = 78r (Same Column Multiplying Column implies Undershoot into the Next Rotation)
8r * 11r = 88r (Is just Normal Multiplication)
8r * 1,11,11r = 8,88,88r (Cascading Multiplication Pattern)

## Verdict: Round8 Still the Victory

Noting that due to the Full Twist being some
7,88,88,88,88,88,88,88,88,88,88 we do use 1.7% of that Count Range leaving the Total Improvement at 12.5%.

Likewise due to the consistency of this trend we should point out that Round8 Unsigned to 64 bits would only have a 7% lead over Hex Binary at 64 bits like its 16-bit prior.

However when you place the Network Effect into Perspective. That is a minimum of a 7% Performance Improvement regardless of Bit Range that increases to 14.29% when fit to the exact Range of Round8.

Finally, we should note that this is just the Representation Space differential. What comes into view after such is the difference of Calculation.

### 64-bit Unsigned Comparison: Short Rotation Case (1 bit into Rotation)
7% is the Minimum when cut off at 1 bit into a Range, 14.29% is the Maximum at Full Range Expressed (3 bits per Rotation). Where 1 bit enables our Marquee to Count into the Final Range of 64 bits, but would have no Final Twist Case. Would still Feature the Same 7% Performance Improvement as Unsigned 16 bits.
