How does Round8 Beat Hex at 16bits?
Our Columnar Marquee System:
```
Unsigned Round8 UnHexed 16Bit Binary
0 000 000 000 001 111 = 8
0 000 000 001 111 111 = 88
0 000 001 111 111 111 = 8,88
0 001 111 111 111 111 = 8,88,88
1 111 111 001 111 111 = 18,88,88 | Count of 70216
```

Why is the 16bit so important? Every internet pack would carry 7% More Data. Every 16bit operation would be 7% more efficient.

Thus within this Framing. We have enough room to Call Victor to Round8 for any Information Equal to or Greater than 16bits. Where we begin at the floor with a Ridiculous 7% More Digits Represented in Binary than Hex.
```
Hexed Binary
1111 1111 , 1111 1111 16 bits @ 65,536
1111 , 1111 1111 , 1111 1111 20bits @ 1,048,576
1111 1111 , 1111 1111 , 1111 1111 24bits @ 16,777,216
```
Then note the Major Success that Stratimux brings to the Table via the Study of Abstractions and their Underlying Manifolds. Enables the creation of "Bidirectional Higher Ordered Look Up Tables," or simply Manifold Spools enable the Relative Position of Bits for Increased Combinations. And Immunity from Shor's Factorization Attack on Binary Operands. So Counter Intuitively, where people would actually Fail to Understand this Paradigm Shift. Is the Exact Point this Paradigm shift is Quantum Proof by a Measure of Current Techniques.

The Issue Here. Is that Prior to 16bits the System is not as Efficient as Hexed Binary, but after **16bits...**

What was Once in Civilization, a **Y2K** is at our doorstep *Once Again.*

(Note it is known that we are using binary operations in order to inform our modern day switches. This method is similar, but instead uses the signals relatively alongside bidirectional higher ordered compositional principles. No intended value judgement on that creates an arbitrary symbol. This demonstrates the limit perceptual scope of unidirectional associations without bidirectional conference.)

# For the Brave
## ADDENDUM: How is this Base 72 Recursive Self Referential?
What is unique about Round8 is that it is based on a spatial coordinate system that has only 1 Zero in it's count at a Origin. While truncating the need for a 10th Place. Meaning the usual expectations of an Octal Counting System does not apply. As such still maintains a Non-Columnar Design.

How?
0 Decimal = 0 Round8 as Origin.
8 Decimal = 8 Round8.
9 Decimal = 11 Round8.

Effectively due to the Truncation of Arbitrary Placeholder positions in the baseline we have an extra 2 extra symbol spaces available. As once the Rotation Completes. Rather than creating an Arbitrary 10th Place. The next possible counting position activates and Adds to the Stack of Counts.

Likewise the Reason for this being a Spatial Coordinate System Deals with the System being Designed for Graphs. Where the Only True 0 in Reality is the Origin of the Graph. Wherein the Limitation of 8 Counts is due to how we Subdivide our Circles on a Graph.

As when you start in Base 10 Decimal at a Count of 10 for the Total Representation of the Degrees of a Circle Subdivided. What is 10 / 2 = 5. Halt! You can't subdivide the Space further Without Maintaining a Fraction or Decimal.

Thus if we Limit the Degrees of a Circle Subdivided to Round Numbers. 2, 4, 8, 16. At 16 you run into the exact same issue as the Prior. In Base 10 Decimal, you have an Extra Position for the 10th Place which imposes an Offset in the Symbol Space. Thus we can only have our Round Counts be Represented via 2 - 8. Where 8 is the Maximum Expression Space prior to our typical requirement of a 10th Place.

Keep in Frame, that Roman Numerals were Once the Defacto. They still represented a Count, but the true Advent of Mathematics was due to the Arabic Numeral System. But with the invention of 0. So too did 0 become a Placeholder Position in the Counting System. The issue there is that there is No Such Thing as 0, outside of an Absolute Zero within our Physics System.

This is where the Bidirectional Advent of this Counting System Comes In. We Stand on the Shoulder of Giants.

Thus if we have our Degrees of a Circle Represented as 8. And we Subdivide. 8 / 2 = 4, 4 / 2 = 2, 2 / 2 = 1. It's a Whole Round Counting System. Noting that in Geometry we already acknowledge this. We don't divide our Circles into 10ths expecting to be able to divide further than 5. As once you do so, the Division is Not Round. Which is the Reason for the Distinction of the System from Base Systems as Round.

So what is the Maximum Count of 64bits? The issue is our current Base Mathematics System has an Offset and does not have the ability to represent a Higher Accuracy Round Number Space, especially in the Higher Ranges that can fit on Binary. On top of that while it is Base 72 starting at Two Rotations or Two Positions of 8s. The Reason for Such is that the Base System is 8*9. Where the First 8, is the First Rotation, and then the Next 8s are the Second Rotation Counting the Number of 8s by 8. This Trend then Continues for the Entire Length. 

Noting how Base Octal Systems are Limited to 70 Number Representations in the Same Space. We can see this as a Compounding Error Rate, but in the scope of Stored Expression, and lose the same efficiency due to the extract arbitrary symbols.

Decimal does not fit in Binary < Round8 Does
Base 16 as Hex < Base 72 as Round8

The goal will be to translate into RoundX that is a drop in replacement for Base 10. Can easily output either.

### How to Count to 8 on one Hand.
Note in Fingers.
0. Closed Hand
1. Index
2. Index + Middle
3. Index + Middle + Ring
4. Index + Middle + Ring + Pinky
5. Index + Middle + Ring + Pinky + Thumb Extended
6. (Index + Thumb) + Middle + Ring + Pinky + Thumb in Play 
7. Index + (Middle + Thumb) + Ring + Pinky + Thumb in Play 
8. Index + Middle + (Ring + Thumb) + Pinky + Thumb in Play 

Notice how we hit our Max Count? And still have a Pinky Left Over? Relative, but unlike how our Thumb Acts like a Round8 Marquee.

### RoundX Future - How to Count to X on One Hand
0. Closed Hand
1. Index
2. Index + Middle
3. Index + Middle + Ring
4. Index + Middle + Ring + Pinky
5. Index + Middle + Ring + Pinky + Thumb Extended
6. (Index + Thumb) + Middle + Ring + Pinky + Thumb in Play 
7. Index + (Middle + Thumb) + Ring + Pinky + Thumb in Play 
8. Index + Middle + (Ring + Thumb) + Pinky + Thumb in Play 
9. Index + Middle + Thumb + (Pinky + Thumb) + Thumb in Play 
X. Hang Ten / Hang Loose.

### RoundX How do you Count to 100 with Two Hands?
XX. (Hang Ten / Hang Loose) on Two Hands X * X = XX 

### Round8 How do you Count to 88 with Two Hands?
88. Index + Middle + (Ring + Thumb) + Pinky + Thumb in Play on Two Hands.

Thus within the Same Amount of Space on your Hands. You have the Representation of More Information in the Same Space.

### How to Count to a Billion in Less than a Minute on your Hands
Where 1,000,000,000 = X,XX,XX,XX,XX
(X,XX,XX,XX,XX - Hang Ten / Hang Loose) on Two Hands X * 4 Shakes = XX,XX,XX,XX + Hang Ten / Hang Loose as One Shake of One Hand = X,XX,XX,XX,XX === 1,000,000,000

As in RoundX. We don't Need a Placeholder. But when we Do Count in that Position, like our Round8 Marquees it Exists but we Don't Need to Represent It. Until we Start Counting the Next Wrung.

Round8 is for Binary
RoundX is an Interchange for Base 10 that Provides Shakes of our Hands to Understand the Scale of Billions.

Keeping in Frame that our Counts are Accurate, but if you are working in a Geometric Space. You Still Would Not Divide in our Round System, like our Base System. A Circle into Xths, but have it be Represented by Rounds.

In Xs we Compose a Linear Counting System that is Valuable in that is it Flattens the Curve that Round8 Matches in it's Twisting Compounding Rotations. Where that Exact Curve is the Exact Reason why Predicting the Max Range in Round8, without the Eventual Mapping of RoundX is on the RoadMap.

What is that Curve? The Limit of our Spatial Reality, as without Such there Would be no Circles, Squares, or Triangles.

### Why a Y2K?
Round8 Orders Information more Efficiently than Binary Operand Operations. It's Clear and Set Method inline with our Higher Order Data Structures as Manifolds as Spools. Enables us to have a Safe Secure Future for All in a Post Shor's Advent, without having to Upgrade Every Computer.

As this System is not a Method of Compression, Nor is it Encryption. It's Too Big and Counter Intuitive for Conventional Linear Counting. But those Qualities is what makes it the Perfect Hex Replacement. It Enhances Current Encryption with the Method of Storage Interchanged. That Removes Shor's Attack Vector of Factorization. As instead we utilize the Advent of Stratimuxian Manifolds, handling our Operations via a Clear and Set Operation.

Just within the 7% Power Savings for Each Ram, Storage, and Internet Communication. In Total World Energy Savings we have a Formative Method of Creating a Marketplace in the Same Space. This is not Extraction, this is Value Creation and is the Essence of the Purest Form of Capitalism. The Creation of Marketplaces where Such Did not Exist Prior.

Are we Worse Off due to Y2K? Would we be Worse Off pending Random Breakthrough that would Invalidate the Majority of Encryption?

This is the Largest Invisible Problem of our Modern Age and 7% is the Floor of Energy Savings. Via a Coordinate Effort and the Redirection of Funds due to Energy Savings Across our Economies. We Create Capital, we Create Good Reward Reasonable Work(jobs), we Create the Possibility for More Formation of Capital and an True Unlimited Marketplace in the Same Space.

7% More Fossil Fuel, 7% More Coal, 7% More Natural Gases, and 7x Less Wasted Lithium. Within those Savings are Jobs the Essence of Capitalism as a Method of Value Creation. Not burning our Finite Resources and Throwing Such into Landfills and Oceans. That is UnCapital, Loss of Value, not Value Creation that is Center to the Truest Form of Capitalism.

This is the Advent of Formatic Capitalism. The Idea that the Formation of Capital is the Value that Capital Produces.

50%. Is not the Ceiling.
60% Is not the Ceiling.
70% Is not the Ceiling.
70% Less Fuel and Resources being Wasted in UnCapital via Every Computer System on the Planet.

What was Climate Change Again? Strange Issue to Dispute if the Ground of this Advent Solves Such. While Creating 7% More Capital to Circulate into our Economies, Increasing GDP World Wide.

UnHex Binary and the Waste of UnCapital that is Hexed Binary.

Crowd Funding and Subsequent Training Material through Such Coming Soon.

Thank you for your Patience in this Formatic Capitalism Advent. This would be the Precision and Error Correction Marketplace. Is the One to Break Ground to Enable the Rest on an Unlimited Frontier Bounded by our Reasonability.
