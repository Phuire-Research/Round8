Round8
111 , 111 111 , 111 111 15 Bits @ 37448 Decimal

1, 111 , 111 111 , 111 111 16<N>15 Bits @ 70216 Decimal

Using 3 bits to represent 8 Counts (1-8, not 0-7), each Round8 Bit is 2.67~ Digits. Where at 16<N>15 bits Round8 breaks 70216 where N is 1,88,88 Round8. We are still under the 16bit digit representation of Hex within the Same Range.

Thus within this Framing. We have enough room to Call Victor to Round8 for any Information Equal to or Greater than 16bits. Where we begin at the floor with a Ridiculous 7% More Digits Represented in Binary than Hex.

Hexed Binary
1111 1111 , 1111 1111 16 bits @ 65,536

1111 1111 , 1111 1111 , 1111 1111 24bits @ 16,777,216

(Note it is known that we are using binary operations in order to inform our modern day switches. This method is similar, but instead uses the signals relatively alongside bidirectional higher ordered compositional principles. No intended value judgement on that creates an arbitrary symbol. This demonstrates the limit perceptual scope of unidirectional associations without bidirectional conference.)
