1,88,88: Count of 70216 <- Round8 Surpasses Hex Binary ~7%

How does Round8 Beat Hex at 16bits?
Keep in frame our Columnar Marquee System:
```
Round8 UnHex Binary
0 000 000 000 001 111 = 8
0 000 000 001 111 111 = 88
0 000 001 111 111 111 = 8,88
0 001 111 111 111 111 = 8,88,88
1 111 111 001 111 111 = 18,88,88 | Count of 70216
```

Why is the 16bit so important? Every internet pack would carry 7% More Data. Every 16bit operation would be 7% more efficient.

Thus within this Framing. We have enough room to Call Victor to Round8 for any Information Equal to or Greater than 16bits. Where we begin at the floor with a Ridiculous 7% More Digits Represented in Binary than Hex.
```
Hexed Binary
1111 1111 , 1111 1111 16 bits @ 65,536
1111 , 1111 1111 , 1111 1111 20bits @ 1,048,576
1111 1111 , 1111 1111 , 1111 1111 24bits @ 16,777,216
```
Then note the Major Success that Stratimux brings to the Table via the Study of Abstractions and their Underlying Manifolds. Enables the creation of "Bidirectional Higher Ordered Look Up Tables," or simply Manifold Spools enable the Relative Position of Bits for Increased Combinations. And Immunity from Shor's Factorization Attack on Binary Operands. So Counter Intuitively, where people would actually Fail to Understand this Paradigm Shift. Is the Exact Point this Paradigm shift is Quantum Proof by a Measure of Current Techniques.

The Issue Here. Is that Prior to 16bits the System is not as Efficient as Hexed Binary, but after **16bits...**

What was Once in Civilization, a **Y2K** is at our doorstep *Once Again.*

(Note it is known that we are using binary operations in order to inform our modern day switches. This method is similar, but instead uses the signals relatively alongside bidirectional higher ordered compositional principles. No intended value judgement on that creates an arbitrary symbol. This demonstrates the limit perceptual scope of unidirectional associations without bidirectional conference.)
