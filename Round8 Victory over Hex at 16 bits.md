Round8
111 , 111 111 , 111 111 15 Bits @ 37448

Using 3 bits to represent 8 Counts (1-8, not 0-7), each Round8 Bit is 2.67~ Digits. Where at 16<N>15 bits Round8 breaks 70216 where N is 1,88,88 Round8. We are still under the 16bit digit representation of Hex within the Same Range.

Thus within this Framing. We have enough room to Call Victor to Round8 for any Information Equal to or Greater than 16bits.

Hex
1111 1111 , 1111 1111 16 bits @ 65,536
1111 , 1111 1111 , 1111 1111 20bits @ 1,048,576
1111 1111 , 1111 1111 , 1111 1111 24bits @ 16,777,216
